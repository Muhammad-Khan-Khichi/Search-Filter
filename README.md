# 🔍 Search Filter Demo

A simple **search filter web app** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It displays a collection of items (with images and names) and allows the user to filter them in real-time using a search input.

## 💻 How It Works
1. All items are stored inside a **JavaScript array** (`data`).  
2. On page load, all items are rendered in a grid.  
3. When you type in the search bar:  
   - The input value is matched against the item names.  
   - Matching items are displayed.  
   - Non-matching items are hidden.
